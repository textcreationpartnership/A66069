            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>It is the lot of Gods people to be environed with fierce and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies, on all ſides, from all quarters of the world.</hi> It is the lot of the godly to be beleaguered with horned Beaſts.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee what theſe <hi>Carpenters</hi> are; here is foure to <note place="margin">The Originall word ſignifies, <hi>Omnis generis Artifices,</hi> Luth.</note> foure; <hi>Luther</hi> obſerves out of the originall, that by Carpenters we muſt underſtand Artificers of all ſorts, whoſe skill and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry God made uſe of in the building of the Temple: The truth is, <hi>Luther</hi> underſtands by <hi>fabri Angelos, quibus haec imperia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandata ſunt;</hi> by Carpenters, he meanes the Angels to whoſe care the cuſtody of thoſe Empires was entruſted; But it ſeems more congruous to take Carpenters here in this place for ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:108953:6"/> as God did raiſe up to be the Executioners of his vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hornes that had ſo afflicted and ſcattered his people, and hindred the building of the Temple; he cals them <hi>Carpenters,</hi> to intimate that their work is twofold; Firſt, for plucking down; Secondly, for rearing up. <hi>Cyrus</hi> who was the chiefe Carpenter which God employed to ſaw off the <hi>Babylonian</hi> hornes, was to pluck down that vaſt Fabrick of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and ſo by that make way for building of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is conſiderable to take notice of the alteration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion uſed in the two viſions; It is ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the foure hornes, but the Lord ſhewed me the foure Carpenters.</hi>

            <p>It is further obſerved concerning the time when theſe Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſhewed; the enemies they appeare moſt when the Church hath any promiſe drawing towards an accompliſhment, but the deliverers are ſhewed when the Church ſeemes to bee drawing towards her end, when ſhee is gaſping for life; for the time when theſe Carpenters were ſhewed, was when the Church was at the loweſt ebbe; <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>For this preſent I ſhall fix upon the two laſt propoſitions, and handle them diſtinctly and ſeverally.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108953:7"/>
            <p>The firſt of the two which is the fifth, is this, <hi>That God then raiſeth up deliverers, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the method which God uſeth to take; Our account and his in reſpect of times and ſeaſons differ like as the <hi>Gregorian</hi> and the <hi>Iulian,</hi> the one out-runnes the other; we in our account commonly antedate deliverances and mercies; but God hee ſeemes to us to poſtdate them, and his appointed time ſeemes to be paſt the time appointed, his ſet day of deliverance, ſeemes to be a day too late commonly, a yeer ſometimes; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is past, the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved:</hi> Gods time of help is when the time of help is paſt. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 35. It is ſaid concerning the enemies of Gods people, <hi>That their foot ſhall ſlide in due time, and God will render vengeance,</hi> and v. 36. <hi>he will repent himſelfe for his ſervants:</hi> now it is obſerveable when the due time ſpoken of is, in the 36. v. it is ſaid, <hi>when he ſeeth that his ſervants power is gone,</hi> then is the Lords due time to take vengeance of their Adverſaries and to deliver them.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 16. 17 the Lord gives comforts, and the ground is this, <hi>There is hope in thine end,</hi> ſaith the Lord; when there was an end of hope in a manner, it is ſaid there is hope in their end: When the knife is at the throat, then, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God then interpoſeth he puts in then unexpectedly and to admiration, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33. 7. 8. 9. you ſhall read of a ſtrange preface to a deliverance ſpoken of v. 10. when hopes are cut off; <hi>Then will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord, now will I lift up my ſelfe, now will I be exalted:</hi> God raiſed up <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to deliver his people, even when <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thought the buſineſſe of ſuch difficulty and impoſſibility, that hee was very unwilling to adventure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 13. Nay, <hi>Moſes</hi> thought that God had even forgot himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Whereas the time promiſed was not come, though it were neare; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ſeemed to be farther off, by how much the nearer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> quarrels with <hi>Moſes</hi> and bids him get him gone, but <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 40. 41. God obſerved his time even to a day: Gods appointed time is ever ſeaſonable, though ſometime it ſeemes late: Inſtances are many, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. at the red Sea, God appeared in the Mount: Look throughout the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> the Scripture is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this argument.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108953:8"/>
            <p>But here a queſtion may bee ſeaſonably made, Why doth God put off the deliverance of his ſervants even to the laſt moment, when things ſeeme to be paſt recovery?</p>

It is ſaid concerning Gods people, <hi>Thy bruiſe is incurable, thy wound is grievous,</hi> v. 12. &amp; 15. <hi>thy ſorrow is incurable,</hi> and yet v. 17. it is ſaid, <hi>I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heale thee of thy wounds, &amp;c.</hi> when the matter is paſt cure, then it is fitteſt for him to cure, who can heale incurable wounds.</p>

            <p>The Babylonian hornes which hindered the deliverance of Gods
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108953:10"/> people, and the building of the Temple, were knocked off and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and others that God raiſed up, and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> went on, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enemies prevailed ſo far, that they hindered the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5, 6. &amp; 24. then cap. 6. 1, 2. &amp;c. you have a Decree for the building: Then <hi>Haggai's</hi> and <hi>Zacharies</hi> propheſies ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them up to build, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. the Mountaine that ſtood before <hi>Zorobabel</hi> is made plain.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is plain, <hi>Zech</hi> 4. 6. becauſe when God ſets men on worke where there be leaſt hopes of doing any good, yet the work ſhall go on, <hi>Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,</hi> ſayes God. It is not thus to be underſtood, as if he would make uſe of no inſtruments, for he did then make uſe of Carpenters for the building of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but <hi>by my Spirit, i. e.</hi> I will ſo rule, and order, and diſpoſe of things by my Spirit, thoſe means that I ſhall uſe, that it ſhall appeare I did it, and that my name was written upon every part of the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>It appeares to be Gods Spirit and hand in bringing things to paſſe; firſt, when a matter falls out unexpectedly, and ſtrangely, and ſuddenly, as we ſee that deliverance of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 26, 27. Or ſecondly, when God workes by contraries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 4. as when light ſprings out of darkneſſe, or when that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for ruine, becomes an Antidote, when the wicked are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their owne crafts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 15, 16. Thirdly, when God works by weak and contemptible meanes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 27. 28. Fourthly, when many caſualties and accidents falling in together, are wiſely ordered to advance a buſineſſe, as appeares in <hi>Mordecai's</hi> caſe, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>So that when God calls men to any ſpeciall ſervice, it ſhall be done for he engageth himſelfe in a ſpeciall manner for the doing of it: Whence it is, that God for the encouragement of his ſervants in great buſineſſes, tells them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Beſides, by how much the more diligent you be in your work, by ſo much the more diligent will Satan be to reſiſt you. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4. The Dragon ſtood before the woman which was ready to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to devoure the child ſo ſoone as it was born; now that you are in travell ready to be delivered of a male child, of ſome good deſigne, the Dragon ſtands before you, not to be a Mid-wife to deliver, but an Executioner to ſtrangle the child in the birth, or to devoure it ſo ſoone as it is borne: Since you have to do with a brood of Serpents, you muſt expect, that the Serpent will ſend out of his mouth a flood, as he did after the woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 15. waters of Perſecutions from all parts; When <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> the High Prieſt appeared before the Lord, <hi>Satan ſtood at his right hand to hinder him, Zech.</hi> 3. 1. but God rebuked him, ver. 2.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, whatſoever may be objected almoſt by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement <note place="margin">Particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by way of parallel drawn from the Type, and the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, from the builders of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> of old, and the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods houſe under the laſt times of the Goſpel.</note> to you, you may find to have fallen upon thoſe that built the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who were your Type, and you ſhall finde that notwithſtanding all diſcouragements the building went on; which certainly muſt needs animate and quicken you, when you finde the parallel to be ſutable.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that the buſineſſe is very ſad and mournfull? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, there is cauſe of mourning, but there is cauſe of rejoycing too. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3. 12. at the laying of the foundation of the Temple there was weeping, (I confeſſe upon another ſtile) and there was rejoycing to, becauſe the foundation was laid, that there was ſome pregnant hopes of a building towards, which they might hope would come to an accompliſhment in due time</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are ſcandalized and reproched, and the work vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſcorned. <hi>Anſw. Ezr.</hi> 4. 12. there you have an invective; and <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 19. when <hi>Sanballat,</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Geſhem</hi> heard of it, they laughed us to ſcorne, and deſpiſed us, and ſaid, <hi>What is this thing that yee doe? will yee rebell againſt the K.</hi> but take notice
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108953:12"/> of the pious anſwer, ver. 20. Again, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 1. 2. 3. You ſhall finde reproaches full of venome and indignation againſt the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the builders; but yet for all this the building went on.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we are not only reproached, but the Adverſary is in Armes againſt us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was the caſe of the builders of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for when the enemies ſaw they could not laugh and ſcorne them from the work, they then levied forces to beat them from the work, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 8. but yet the work went on, and by that meanes it went on, ſee v. 9. But if it be ſo, how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that we ſhould both defend and build? <hi>Anſw.</hi> How did the builders of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> they fought and built at once, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 16. 17. 18. and they did proſper and goe on. Nay, ſuch was their conſtant oppoſition, that they were compelled to watch ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and diligently, <hi>That they did not put off their clothes, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for waſhing,</hi> ver. 23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the buſineſſe is now grown to that paſſe, that it is ſo heavie and ſo chargeable, that there is a great cry and clamour of the people by reaſon of taxations, and by reaſon of continuall watching and labouring at the works, men are conſtrained to leave their Trades, and Trade decaying, men now ſpend upon the ſtock; nay, many a mans ſtock is already ſpent, ſo that they are compelled to borrow upon uſe, whereupon there be many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and repinings amongſt us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was juſt the caſe of them that built <hi>Jeruſalem, Neh.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. the very ſelfe-ſame words that were then ſpoken are now taken up, and there is much like the ſame reaſons and grounds: But obſerve the wiſdome and zeale of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in this caſe, how he behaved himſelfe in the verſes following, from the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and conſider the iſſue moſt happy, in the verſes after.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, but the people of the land are diſaffected both to us, and the work. <hi>Anſw. Ez.</hi> 4. 4. 5. <hi>The people of the land weakned the hands of the people of Iudah, and troubled them in building, and hired Counſellours againſt them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, our Adveriaries lay their deſignes deep, they work under ground. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it was with them anciently, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>their Adverſaries ſaid, They ſhall not know, neither ſee, till we come in the midſt among them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to ceaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:108953:12"/>
            <p>Seventhly, many great ones draw back, the Nobles many of them will not put their hand to the work. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>The Nobles put not their neck to the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eightly, we are dealt withall by way of treaty and friendly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, places of meeting are propoſed, and the truth is, their traines of love, are trains of powder to blow us up. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it was with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 6. 2. he was ſent to by <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Geſhem,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come let us meet together in ſome one of the Villages in the plaine of Ono; but they thought to doe me a miſchiefe:</hi> Whether the caſe at a Town not farre off be not much like this, and whether miſchiefe were not intended, let the event ſpeak; but obſerve what anſwer <hi>Nehemiah</hi> made, v. 3. Nay, they ſent to him foure times, but he gave them the ſame anſwer, <hi>He had a great work in hand, ſo that I cannot come down, &amp;c.</hi> I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to preſcribe what anſwer you ſhould give.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, we have open Declarations againſt us, and the world is told that we rebell, and that we think upon ſtrong matters, ſuch things as never entred into our hearts. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Juſt ſo it was with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> c. 6. v. 5. 6. they ſend an open letter to them to that purpoſe it might be known to the world, and that they might affright them with that terrible word of Rebellion. Nay, it is ſaid that they employed Prophets to Preach their Rebellious intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they might be communicated more eaſily and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the people; this was ſaid then, v. 7. and let the ſame anſwer that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> made, be now made alſo, ver. 8.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, we had thoſe that are ſet on purpoſe to draw and entice us into unwarrantable courſes, that ſo there might be a juſt matter of acculation againſt us; ſome have been tempted on purpoſe for that end, that ſo we might lie open to their imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> caſe, c. 6. v. 10. hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by <hi>Shemaiah</hi> to goe with him into the houſe of God, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was not ſafe for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to be in the City; now this would have engaged <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in a diſhonourable act, to flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, this might have favoured of feare, and then others might have been diſheartned, and therefore he entertaines the offer with indignation, and ſaid, <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> v. 11. Secondly, it would have engaged <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in an unlawfull act; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108953:13"/> 
               <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> obſerve, that it was not lawfull for him to go into the Temple, and to that purpoſe they urge that Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 38. and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſeems to intimate the unlawfulneſſe of the thing, v. 12. he ſayes, <hi>and loe, I perceived that God had not ſent him, but that he was hired to make him afraid, and ſinne,</hi> v. 13.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, but we have thoſe that do entertain commerce and entercourſe with our Adverſaries. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So it was antiently, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 17. It is ſaid, <hi>in thoſe dayes the Nobles of Iudah ſent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them:</hi> It ſeems the Nobles were rotten in thoſe dayes, ſome of them; nay more, many of them, in <hi>Iudah</hi> ſome were ſworn to <hi>Tobiah,</hi> becauſe he was the Sonne-in-Law of <hi>Shecaniah,</hi> it ſhould ſeeme he was well allyed, ver. 18. &amp; in the 19. ver. you may ſee the end of the letters, why they were ſent, and why they told the proceedings of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to his Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, the people of the Land are unprepared, and are apt to draw back and hinder the work. <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſo it was in the time of building the Temple, as appeares, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, Our enemies are not onely potent, but crafty. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So were the enemies of thoſe that built <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but that is no matter, for <hi>Iſ.</hi> 47. 10, 11. it is one of the judgements againſt <hi>Babylon, For all her divinations and ſubtlety, that they ſhall not know how and whence their evill ſhall come upon them.</hi> Theſe be diſcouragements I confeſſe, for <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 9. it is ſaid <hi>they made us afraid;</hi> but for all this the building went on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, it may be added further, That there be mighty Commotions, and ſtirres, and tumults here and in other parts of Chriſtendom. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That muſt be expected; The over-turning and caſting down of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is a great part of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters work, muſt be with great Commotions; When the dayes of old <hi>Babylons</hi> ruine did approach, <hi>there was a noiſe of a multitude, a tumultuous noiſe of the Kingdomes and Nations gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iſ.</hi> 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 4. Doe but look over <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. &amp; 51. chap. to this purpoſe: And ſo it ſhall bee in the plucking down of myſticall <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 16. 17. 18. Kingdomes ſhall be turned upſide down; Doe you think that when God raiſeth up the hearts of men to wound the beaſt that hath ſeven heads and ten hornes, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 7.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108953:13"/> 
               <hi>the hornes that are upon the head of the beaſt, which are ten Kings</hi> v. 12. will not lay about them, when they ſee the very head of the beaſt which bears the hornes ſtruck at, that it may be quite ſtruck off never to riſe more?</p>
            <p>Beſides for further anſwer to this, you muſt expect great noiſes and tumults upon another ground, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. The Temple of the Lord was opened, and the Arke of his testament;</hi> That is, thoſe myſteries that were ſhut up and were not diſcerned formerly, but by learned men and great Schollers, theſe onely were admitted into the Temple, to look into the Arke; but now the Temple is opened, and the Arke diſcovered, any Chriſtians (though weak) yet might goe and ſee and know the myſteries of Religion, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently hidden from the eyes of the Vulgar; What followed upon this? <hi>Lightnings, and noiſes, and thunders, and earthquaks, and a great haile;</hi> that is, great tumults, and commotions, and troubles; for the world envying the happineſſe of Gods people in this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, did fret, and bite the tongue, and murmure, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the people of God.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, wee have of the moſt religious people that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are not many of them: godly men may be 1 ignorant, and ſo miſled; and they may be 2 froward and pettiſh, and ſo may fret; or they may 3 have intereſts and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that look another way. Now when godly men look upon you through theſe glaſſes, they may be allowed to judge amiſſe; However it was the caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> he had not onely wicked and ungodly men that did oppoſe him, as you read, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 5, 6, &amp;c. and <hi>Act.</hi> 21. but <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 50. <hi>The devout women, and the chiefe men of the City raiſed perſecution againſt Paul and Barnabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, it is ſaid, wee goe on ſlowly. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Temple was many yeares in building: Bleſſed be God you doe goe on, great bodies move by leiſure; Reformation work is heavy work; and there be many obſtructions: <hi>There is much rubbiſh,</hi> as there was <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>ſo that they were not able to build the wall;</hi> But bleſſed bee God, many of the utenſils, and moveables, and much of the trumpery are caſt out already; a vaſt old frame muſt be pluckt down; many horns muſt be knockt off; many rough ſtones and knotty pieces you ſhall meet withall, to be ſquared
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108953:14"/> and poliſht: And there be more builders of <hi>Babel</hi> then there are builders of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> more that would pluck down, then reare up the walls of <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, it may bee ſaid that you ſhall never live to ſee or enjoy your labours in this great work; it being a buſineſſe ſo vaſt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you doe contribute any thing to ſo bleſſed a work, <hi>your labour ſhall not bee in vaine in the Lord: David</hi> thought himſelfe much honoured, that hee might prepare materials for the Temple. It is a happineſſe to you to begin that, which is the hope of the preſent age, and ſhall be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and the glory of poſterity: And yet it may bee that that promiſe may bee made good to you, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 65. 22. 23. what is ſaid of houſes there, perhaps may bee made good in this building, and that to you, <hi>That you ſhall build and inhabit, you ſhall plant and eat the fruits of the planting; and mine Elect ſhall long enjoy the work of their hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have you had the diſcouragements removed, I come to <note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the work laid down.</note> the incouragements to the work. 1. The Word is gone forth for ruine againſt <hi>Babylon, Rev.</hi> 14. 8. &amp; 18. 2. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> the word is doubled, ſo that her ruine is certaine, it is irreſiſtible, and irreparable; a great part of your work is done to your hands; ſo that though all the World cry up <hi>Babylon,</hi> it ſhall not bee able to reare one ſtone of it againe; So that for plucking down, which is a great part of your work, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done: Shee is fallen in Gods ſentence, and ſhee is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, her execution drawes nigh. 2. The word of promiſe is gone forth, <hi>Aedificabo Eccleſiam, Mat.</hi> 16. 18. Now let all the world cry it down, they ſhall not prevaile, the word of Gods command is a word of power, it is invincible, there is no ſtanding againſt that word: <hi>Iſ.</hi> 44. 20. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 28. there is a commanding promiſe full of majeſty and might, and upon this promiſe followes the work, and the work-men fall to the buſineſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 1. 2. 3. I might give many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to this purpoſe, but they all empty themſelves into that which is named; now although the Decrees of Princes ſhould ſtand in the way to oppoſe the Decree of God, they ſhall doe no good, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 11.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108953:14"/>
            <p>3 Many prayers are ſent up to heaven for theſe very purpoſes; the cloud that was no bigger then a mans hand, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 44. was a token of a great deale of raine, but that could of incenſe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 13. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 2. that is aſcended to heaven, has covered not the Mercy ſeat onely, but the Heavens, and certainely this cloud will fall downe in ſhowers of mercy.</p>
            <p>4 The eyes of all true Chriſtians are upon you, and their hopes and intereſts ſeem to be embarqued in you: certainly a Veſſell laden with ſo precious engagements and intereſts of the preſent and future ages, cannot miſcarry. <hi>Caeſarem vehis,</hi> was thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough to the boat-man, who wafted over the great Commander of the world in a tempeſt; you carry the intereſts of Chriſt, and therefore although the Sea be rough and dangerous, you need not feare.</p>
            <p>5 The late Covenant is none of the leaſt encouragements, that triple combination of three Kingdomes will ſhake the Triple Crown; for it was the courſe that Antichriſt took to eſtabliſh his Throne, by confederacies and oathes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16, 17. the mark there may be taken for that indelible character which thoſe that were in orders did receive, (as the Papiſts affirm) when they did bind themſelves by oath to defend and promote the Papall See; or it may be taken for that ſolemn Oath which <note n="a" place="margin">So <hi>Ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

A Nation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by you, (and truly a very miſerable Nation, becauſe a very ſinfull one) I could wiſh your ſorrow were ſuch this day that it might appear you repreſent a Kingdomes ſorrowes, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes teares; I could wiſh that it were ſo great, as that God would accept it for a Kingdome, for ſo God doth ſometime; you being the firſt fruits, who knowes but you may be accepted, and the whole lump for you? I would to God it were proportionable ſome way to the Nations ſinnes which you repreſent; ſo that as it may be ſaid, never any ſinne like <hi>Englands</hi> ſinne, ſo it may alſo be ſaid, never any ſorrow was like your ſorrow: The greateſt mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> are the beſt builders of <hi>Sion:</hi> every ſinne you ſubdue this day, you knock down a horn that puſheth againſt the building of Gods houſe; every luſt that you ſlay this day, you daſh out the braines of a <hi>Babylonian</hi> that hinders the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>God forbid that that complaining reproofe of God againſt the Elders of <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. 4. ſhould be true of any of you; God would not be enquired of by them, becauſe they had Idols in their heart, and put a ſtumbling block of their iniquity before their face, and this made God a ſtranger to them, v. 5. The very firſt work in any Reformation was the caſting down of Idols and removing ſtumbling blocks; let it not be ſaid of any of you, that you carry any Idols in your hearts, which are the greateſt ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, or that you ſhould harbour any <hi>Babylonians</hi> in your boſoms, which ſecretly undermine and pull down that which you ſeeme to build; let this day be a day of throwing down the ſtrong holds of ſinne, and I aſſure my ſelfe it will be a day of rearing up and building.</p>
            <p>The ruine of the Kingdome of Satan, Antichriſt, and Sinne, is the raiſing up of the Kingdome and Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
